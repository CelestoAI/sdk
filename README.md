Celesto runs AI agents and harnesses in a cloud computer. An AI agent is
software that can plan and run tasks. A harness is the code that starts, tests,
or supervises an agent. They can run commands, write files, and use tools
without touching your machine.

Use Celesto when you want to:

- Run an AI agent or harness in a clean computer.
- Run shell commands from Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, or the command line.
- Keep agent work separate from your laptop, server, or production system.
- Manage a computer from start to finish: create, list, run commands, stop,
  start, and delete.
- Run an agent for each of your own users, with a spending limit per user.

This README covers the Python SDK, which is a code package, and the CLI, which
is the `celesto` command. The JavaScript and TypeScript SDK is also available as
[`@celestoai/sdk`](./ts/README.md).

## Install

Install the Python package to get both the SDK and the `celesto` command:

```bash
pip install celesto
```

Celesto requires Python 3.10 or newer.

For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, install the npm package:

```bash
npm install @celestoai/sdk
```

## Get an API Key

An API key is a secret token that lets Celesto know a request is yours. Create
one in [Celesto Settings](https://celesto.ai) under **Settings > Security**.

For SDK code, set the key in your shell before running your program:

```bash
export CELESTO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

For CLI commands, you can save the key once:

```bash
celesto auth login
```

The CLI stores the key in your operating system's secure credential store. On
Linux machines without a credential store, it saves the key in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/celesto/credentials.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, or
`~/.config/celesto/credentials.json` otherwise, with user-only file
permissions. SDK code does not read that saved CLI key; it reads
`CELESTO_API_KEY` or the `api_key` value you pass to `Computer`.

## Create a Computer from Python

This example creates a minimal Ubuntu computer, runs one command, prints the
output, and deletes the computer. Celesto uses the `scratch` template by
default.

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer()
try:
    print(f"Computer ready: {computer.name}")

    result = computer.run("uname -a")
    print(result["stdout"])
finally:
    computer.delete()
```

To pass the key directly instead of using `CELESTO_API_KEY`:

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer(api_key="your-api-key")
try:
    result = computer.run("uname -a")
    print(result["stdout"])
finally:
    computer.delete()
```

## Manage Computers from the CLI

Run these commands in a macOS or Linux shell after `celesto auth login`. The
first command creates a computer with the default `scratch` template.

```bash
celesto computer create
#   Name:   curie
#   ID:     cmp_123
#   Status: creating
```

For later examples, save the generated name in `COMPUTER_NAME`. The command
uses `--json` so Python can read the output.

```bash
COMPUTER_NAME=$(
  celesto computer create --json |
  python3 -c 'import json, sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["name"])'
)
```

Inspect that computer by name or ID:

```bash
celesto computer get "$COMPUTER_NAME"
#   Name:   curie
#   ID:     cmp_123
#   Status: running
```

List your computers:

```bash
celesto computer list
```

Filter the list by status:

```bash
celesto computer list --status running
```

Filter the list by template. Template IDs come from `celesto computer templates`;
`browser-agent` is one ready-made template.

```bash
celesto computer list --template browser-agent
```

Filter the list by project. Replace `proj_123` with a project ID from your
Celesto workspace.

```bash
celesto computer list --project proj_123
```

Limit the number of computers returned:

```bash
celesto computer list --limit 10
```

Run a command in the computer:

```bash
celesto computer run "$COMPUTER_NAME" "uname -a"
```

Use a longer timeout for slow commands. The value is in seconds and must be
between 1 and 300.

```bash
celesto computer run "$COMPUTER_NAME" "sleep 10 && echo done" --timeout 30
```

Stream output while a command is still running:

```bash
celesto computer run "$COMPUTER_NAME" "for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; sleep 1; done" --stream
# 1
# 2
# 3
```

`celesto computer run --json` prints one JSON object for scripts and exits with
the same exit code as the remote command. `celesto computer run --stream --json`
prints one compact JSON event per line.

Current caveat: commands run as the computer image's default exec user. The CLI
and SDK do not yet expose a `--user` option. Run `whoami` first if your script
depends on a specific home directory or file permission.

List templates when you want a computer with tools already installed:

```bash
celesto computer templates
```

Create a computer from a template:

```bash
celesto computer create --template coding-agent
```

Publish port 8000 when a process in the computer needs a public URL:

```bash
celesto computer port publish "$COMPUTER_NAME" --port 8000
# https://p-test.celesto.ai
```

List published ports:

```bash
celesto computer port list "$COMPUTER_NAME"
```

Unpublish the port when you are done:

```bash
celesto computer port unpublish "$COMPUTER_NAME" --port 8000
```

To open an interactive terminal through Celesto's fast terminal gateway, connect
to the same computer. Your account needs write access to that computer:

```bash
celesto computer ssh "$COMPUTER_NAME"
```

Press `Ctrl+]` to exit the terminal, then delete the computer:

```bash
celesto computer delete --force "$COMPUTER_NAME"
```

Use `celesto computer list` to see the computers in your account.

## Manage Computers from JavaScript or TypeScript

In an ESM or TypeScript file:

```ts
import { Computer } from "@celestoai/sdk";

const computer = await Computer.create();
try {
  console.log(`Computer ready: ${computer.name}`);

  const result = await computer.run("uname -a");
  console.log(result.stdout);
} finally {
  await computer.delete();
}
```

See the [JavaScript and TypeScript README](./ts/README.md) for Node.js
requirements, Gatekeeper examples, and terminal connection details.

## Run Agents for Your Users

If you are building a product on top of an AI agent, every run happens for one
of *your* users. Celesto keeps them apart: each run is recorded against the user
it acted for, so you can see what that person's agent did and what it cost, and
stop it from spending more than you allow.

You identify each of your users with a string you already have — a database ID,
an email, anything. Celesto stores it as you send it. There is no Celesto user
ID to look up and no mapping table to keep.

This example creates an agent, runs it for one user, prints the answer as it
arrives, and then reads that user's spending.

```python
from celesto import ManagedAgentsClient

celesto = ManagedAgentsClient()

agent = celesto.agents.create(
    name="support-bot",
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    instructions="Answer order questions in one short paragraph.",
)

for event in celesto.runs.stream(
    agent["id"], input="Where is my order?", end_user_id="usr_8837"
):
    if event.name == "message.delta":
        print(event.text, end="", flush=True)

budget = celesto.end_users.get("usr_8837")["budget"]
print(f"\nSpent {budget['spent_usd']} of {budget['cap_usd']}")
```

`ManagedAgentsClient` reads `CELESTO_API_KEY` the same way `Computer` does.

### Wait Instead of Streaming

`stream()` gives you the answer as it is written. `create()` waits and gives you
the finished run:

```python
run = celesto.runs.create(
    agent["id"], input="Where is my order?", end_user_id="usr_8837"
)
print(run["output"], run["usage"]["cost_usd"])
```

### Money Is Exact

Every amount — `cost_usd`, `spent_usd`, `cap_usd` — is a `Decimal`, not a float.
A single answer can cost a few millionths of a dollar, and floats lose those
when you add them up. Keep the `Decimal`.

That runs both ways: passing a float where an amount is expected raises
`TypeError` rather than sending it. `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004` in
binary, and the only place that can still be fixed is before it leaves your
program. Pass a `Decimal` or a string.

### Set a Spending Limit

Give one user a cap, or set the default for everyone:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

celesto.end_users.update("usr_8837", budget_cap_usd=Decimal("5.00"))
celesto.runtime.update_settings(default_end_user_budget_usd=Decimal("0.50"))
```

The cap covers a 30-day window that starts the first time that user runs
anything. When it runs out, the next run raises `BudgetExceededError`, and a run
already in flight stops at its next step with a `run.failed` event.

### Retry Safely

Pass `idempotency_key` to make a retry safe: sending the same key again returns
the run that already happened instead of running the agent — and charging your
user — twice.

```python
run = celesto.runs.create(
    agent["id"],
    input="Where is my order?",
    end_user_id="usr_8837",
    idempotency_key="order-status-42",
)
```

One conversation runs one agent at a time. If a second run arrives while the
first is still going, Celesto refuses it with `SessionBusyError`. Pass
`max_retries=2` to wait and try again; the SDK creates an idempotency key for
you when you do.

### Keep the Conversation Going

Every run belongs to a session, which is that user's transcript. Leave
`session_id` out and Celesto starts one; pass it back to continue:

```python
run = celesto.runs.create(agent["id"], input="Hello", end_user_id="usr_8837")
follow_up = celesto.runs.create(
    agent["id"],
    input="And the one before that?",
    end_user_id="usr_8837",
    session_id=run["session_id"],
)
```

### Change an Agent

Updating an agent saves a new version and leaves the old ones readable. Runs
remember the version they used, so a change never rewrites what already
happened. `celesto.agents.activate_version(agent_id, 1)` goes back.

## Run Pi in a Celesto Computer

[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) is a coding agent that works from
your terminal. The Celesto extension runs Pi's coding tools in a separate
computer while the interface, conversation history, and model credentials stay
on your machine.

You need Node.js 22.19 or newer and Pi configured with a model provider. Sign
in with `celesto auth login`, export `CELESTO_API_KEY`, or add the key to the
project's local `.env` file. Install the extension once:

```bash
pi install npm:@celestoai/pi
```

From the project you want to work on, start Pi with Celesto:

```bash
pi --celesto
```

Pi starts with an empty `$HOME/workspace` and runs its read, write, edit, and
shell tools there. It does not copy local files automatically. To copy the current
project explicitly, run this inside Pi:

```text
/celesto push
```

After pushing, use `/celesto sync` to copy changes explicitly between the remote
workspace and your local project. Pi never syncs files automatically when it exits.
Use `/celesto status` to see the active computer or `/celesto keep` to preserve
an extension-created computer after Pi exits. See the [Pi extension guide](./pi/README.md)
for reuse and file-exclusion options.

## Python Computers API

Use the Python SDK when you want Celesto inside an app, script, or agent.

### Create

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer(cpus=2, memory=2048, disk="15gb")
try:
    print(computer.name, computer["name"])
finally:
    computer.delete()
```

Omit CPU, memory, or disk fields to use the default size. `disk` accepts MB as
an integer or strings such as `"2gb"`.

### Templates

By default, Celesto uses `scratch`, a minimal Ubuntu computer. Use a template
when you want a computer that already has extra tools installed. For example,
`coding-agent` includes common tools for coding tasks.

List available templates:

```python
from celesto import Computer

templates = Computer.list_templates()
for template in templates:
    print(template["id"], template.get("preinstalled_tools", []))
```

Template responses may include metadata such as aliases, capabilities,
preinstalled tools, recommended uses, default published ports, and browser
support flags. Older template records may omit those fields, so use `.get()`
when your code can run against multiple API versions.

Create a computer from a template:

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer(template_id="coding-agent")
try:
    print(computer.name)
finally:
    computer.delete()
```

### Run a Command

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer()
try:
    result = computer.run("ls -la", timeout=60)
    print(result["exit_code"])
    print(result["stdout"])
    print(result["stderr"])
finally:
    computer.delete()
```

The `timeout` value is the remote command timeout in seconds. The SDK gives the
HTTP request a little more time than the command itself so slow command output
can still return cleanly.

Current caveat: `run()` and `exec()` run as the computer image's default exec
user. The SDK does not yet expose a user selector.

### Create a Terminal Session

Create a terminal session when your application needs an interactive shell. The
returned `url` connects directly to Celesto's fast terminal gateway and contains
a short-lived secret token. Creating a terminal session requires write access to
the computer.

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer.get("curie")
session = computer.create_terminal_session()
print(session["terminal_id"], session["expires_at"])
```

Pass `session["url"]` directly to a WebSocket client before it expires. Do not
log or share the URL because it includes the terminal token.

### List, Stop, Start, and Delete

`computer_id` can be `computer.id` from `Computer()` or a computer name shown by
`celesto computer list`.

Filter a list when you only want matching computers:

```python
from celesto import Computer

computers = Computer.list(status="running", template_id="browser-agent")
for computer in computers:
    print(computer["name"])
```

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Computer.list()` | List computers in your account |
| `Computer.list(status="running", template_id="browser-agent", project_id="proj_123", limit=10)` | List matching computers |
| `Computer.get(computer_id)` | Get one computer by name or ID |
| `computer.create_terminal_session()` | Create a short-lived fast terminal connection |
| `computer.stop()` | Stop a running computer |
| `computer.start()` | Start a stopped computer |
| `computer.delete()` | Delete a computer |

### Publish Ports

Publish an HTTP service on an application port from 1024 through 65535. Each computer can have up to four public ports; Celesto system ports are reserved.

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer.get("curie")
url = computer.publish_port(8000)
print(url)
```

List and remove published ports:

```python
from celesto import Computer

computer = Computer.get("curie")
print(computer.list_published_ports())
computer.unpublish_port(8000)
```

## CLI Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `celesto auth login` | Save your API key for CLI commands |
| `celesto auth status` | Check whether an API key is saved |
| `celesto auth logout` | Remove your saved API key |
| `celesto computer create [--cpus N] [--memory MB] [--disk-size-mb MB] [--template ID]` | Create a computer |
| `celesto computer templates` | List templates with preinstalled tools |
| `celesto computer list` | List your computers |
| `celesto computer list [--status STATUS] [--template ID] [--project ID] [--limit N]` | List matching computers |
| `celesto computer get NAME` | Get one computer by name or ID |
| `celesto computer run NAME "command" [--timeout N]` | Run a command on a computer |
| `celesto computer run NAME "command" --stream` | Stream command output while it runs |
| `celesto computer ssh NAME` | Open an interactive terminal |
| `celesto computer port publish NAME --port 8000` | Publish a computer port |
| `celesto computer port list NAME` | List published ports |
| `celesto computer port unpublish NAME --port 8000` | Unpublish a computer port |
| `celesto computer stop NAME` | Stop a computer |
| `celesto computer start NAME` | Start a stopped computer |
| `celesto computer delete [--force] NAME` | Delete a computer |

Most computer commands support `--json`, which prints structured data for
scripts and automation:

```bash
celesto computer list --json
celesto computer templates --json
celesto computer create --disk-size-mb 15360 --json
```

`celesto computer ssh` is interactive and does not support JSON output.

## Other Python SDK APIs

The high-level SDK now exposes computers directly through `Computer`. Deployment
and Gatekeeper helpers are still available from the CLI while their direct SDK
resource APIs are being updated to match this style.

## OpenAI Agents SDK Sandboxes

OpenAI agents can use Celesto as their working computer. This lets the agent
read files, run commands, and create artifacts in a separate place.

A sandbox is a separate computer where an agent can work. A session is one
running connection to that computer.

Install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install "celesto[openai-agents]"
```

Set both API keys before running the example. Celesto uses `CELESTO_API_KEY` to
create the computer. The OpenAI Agents SDK uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` to run the
agent.

```bash
export CELESTO_API_KEY="your-celesto-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

Then create a sandbox session for the agent:

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Runner
from agents.run import RunConfig
from agents.sandbox import SandboxAgent, SandboxRunConfig
from celesto.integrations.openai_agents import CelestoSandboxClient


async def main() -> None:
    agent = SandboxAgent(
        name="Workspace analyst",
        instructions="Inspect the sandbox workspace before answering.",
    )

    client = CelestoSandboxClient()
    session = await client.create()

    try:
        async with session:
            result = await Runner.run(
                agent,
                "Run `uname -a` in the sandbox and summarize the result.",
                run_config=RunConfig(sandbox=SandboxRunConfig(session=session)),
            )
            print(result.final_output)
    finally:
        await client.delete(session)


asyncio.run(main())
```

If your agent needs common coding tools preinstalled, pass
`options=CelestoSandboxClientOptions(template_id="coding-agent")` when you call
`client.create()`. Import `CelestoSandboxClientOptions` from
`celesto.integrations.openai_agents`.

For local sandbox runs, use `SmolVMSandboxClient` and
`SmolVMSandboxClientOptions` from `celesto.integrations.openai_agents`. SmolVM
is a local tool for running a separate sandbox on your own machine.

## Handle Errors in Python

Catch Celesto exceptions when your app needs custom recovery behavior.

```python
from celesto.sdk.exceptions import (
    CelestoAuthenticationError,
    CelestoNetworkError,
    CelestoNotFoundError,
    CelestoRateLimitError,
    CelestoServerError,
    CelestoValidationError,
)
```

`CelestoRateLimitError` includes a `retry_after` value when the API sends one.

Agent runs add an exception per reason a run can be refused, so you can react to
the specific one. Each is a `ManagedAgentError`, which is a `CelestoError`.

```python
from celesto import BudgetExceededError, SessionBusyError

try:
    run = celesto.runs.create(agent_id, input="Hi", end_user_id="usr_8837")
except BudgetExceededError:
    prompt_the_user_to_upgrade()
except SessionBusyError as busy:
    retry_in(busy.retry_after)
```

The full set: `BudgetExceededError`, `SessionBusyError`,
`IdempotencyConflictError`, `AgentArchivedError`, `ProviderNotConnectedError`,
`SessionAgentMismatchError`, `SessionEndUserMismatchError`,
`ModelRequiresOwnKeyError`, and `ConfigKeyNotAllowedError`.
