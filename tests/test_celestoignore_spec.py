"""Tests for .celestoignore gitignore spec compliance.

These tests verify that .celestoignore follows the gitignore specification:
1. Lines starting with # (after optional whitespace) are comments
2. A # elsewhere in the line is literal unless preceded by whitespace (inline comment)
3. Trailing spaces are ignored unless escaped
4. Patterns with # in the middle should match literally
